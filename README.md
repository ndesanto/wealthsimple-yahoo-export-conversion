# (Unofficial) Wealthsimple to Yahoo export conversion tool

- the code and the html and the css was whipped together very quickly with no regard for code-quality standards :)
- I made this tool for myself because Wealthsimple recently added a CSV export tool and I wanted to track my stocks on Yahoo finance without manually adding/updating everytime i make a change in WS
- I am not an expert in Stocks or anything, my portfolio is pretty simple so if i'm missing any usecases that could be useful let me know
- I did some ticker-conversions for canadian stocks/ what wealthsimple states they accept
- all the instructions on how to use the tool are on the page
- let me know if theres any features that are missing! and/or you want to contribute!
